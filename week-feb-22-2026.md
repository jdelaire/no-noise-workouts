# WEEK February 22 2026

## Sun

### Strength
Bench Press  
Every 3:00 x 4 Sets  
Set 1: 7 Reps at 70%  
Set 2: 6 Reps at 75%  
Set 3: 5 Reps at 80%  
Set 4: 4 Reps at 80%+ % of 1RM Bench Press

### Conditioning
Every 5:00 x 3 Sets  
6 Strict Pull-Ups  
12 Ring Rows  
24 Dual Dumbbell Hammer Curls  
- For the Strict Pull-Ups, we are looking for a challenging set. We can create challenge by adding loads to the pull-ups or moving to strict chest to bar. For scaling purposes, add band tension that allows 6 challenging reps with controlled strict form. Other modifications today would be to move to a challenging toenail spot variation.  
- For the Ring Row, lets look to create an angle that is both challenging, yet sustainable for 12 unbroken reps.  
- Dumbbell Hammer Curls: Light Loads that can be done as 24 unbroken. We can sub out Banded Curls if needed and have a great 24 rep bicep burnout set here at the end of each set  
*Yes, this is a repeat... got some great feedback on the strength stimulus for this one.
